About This Tutorial / Contributing
==================================

Scott Torborg - `storborg@gmail.com <mailto:storborg@gmail.com>`_.

I wrote this tutorial in an attempt to improve the state of Python packages at large. Tools like `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_ and `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_, as well as improvements to `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`_, have made the Python package ecosystem a delight to work in.

However, I frequently run across packages I want to use that don't interoperate correctly with others, or find myself in situations where I'm not sure exactly how to structure things. This is an attempt to fix that.

This documentation is written in reStructuredText and built with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_. The source is open and hosted at http://github.com/storborg/python-packaging.

To build the HTML version, just do this in a clone of the repo::
