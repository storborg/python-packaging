How To Package Your Python Code
===============================

This tutorial aims to put forth an opinionated and specific pattern to make trouble-free packages for community use. It doesn't describe the *only* way of doing things, merely one specific approach that works well.

In particular, packages should make it easy:

* To install with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.
* To specify as a dependency for another package.
* For other users to download and run tests.
* For other users to work on and have immediate familiarity with the basic directory structure.
* To add and distribute documentation.

We'll walk through the basic steps of building up a contrived package **funniest** to support these things.
